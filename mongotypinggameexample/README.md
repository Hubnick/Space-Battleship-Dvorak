# Typing Game App built with MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.

Hello and welcome to my first typing game which is also build with React as part of my React studying.

## to run the project:

- Clone the repository
- npm i from the root directory, and also npm i from client directory
- from root directory: npm run dev - in runs both the server and react

## This app currently build using :

1. **React.js** - Without Redux. not sure if ever will use Redux in the project.
2. **MongoDB** - Mongoose, read, create and update. storing the scores in the Database.
3. **Express/Node** - the server-side implementation.
4. **BEM** - I am practicing with BEM naming conventions.

### Responsive Design

The app is responsive, however, the app only work properly using a keyboard.
